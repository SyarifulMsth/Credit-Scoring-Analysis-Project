# Credit Scoring Analysis

## Project Overview
Credit scoring analysis involves using historical data to predict the credit risk of potential borrowers. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assess whether a borrower is low-risk or high-risk based on certain attributes. This analysis helps financial institutions in making informed decisions about credit issuance.

## Introduction
Credit scoring is a critical aspect of the financial industry, enabling lenders to assess the risk of lending to potential borrowers. This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. By leveraging data science techniques, we aim to provide a robust and accurate credit scoring system.
